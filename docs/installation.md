Livewire is a Laravel package, so you will need to have a Laravel application up and running before you can install and use Livewire. If you need help setting up a new Laravel application, please see the [official Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/installation).

To install Livewire, open your terminal and navigate to your Laravel application directory, then run the following command:

```shell
composer require livewire/livewire
```

That's it â€” really. If you want more customization options, keep reading. Otherwise, you can jump right into using Livewire.

> [!warning] `/livewire/livewire.js` returning a 404 status code
> By default, Livewire exposes a route in your application to serve its JavaScript assets from: `/livewire/livewire.js`. This is fine for most applications, however, if you are using Nginx with a custom configuration, you may receive a 404 from this endpoint. To fix this issue, you can either [compile Livewire's JavaScript assets yourself](#manually-bundling-livewire-and-alpine), or [configure Nginx to allow for this](https://benjamincrozat.com/livewire-js-404-not-found).

## Publishing the configuration file

Livewire is "zero-config", meaning you can use it by following conventions, without any additional configuration. However, if needed, you can publish and customize Livewire's configuration file by running the following Artisan command:

```shell
php artisan livewire:publish --config
```

This will create a new `livewire.php` file in your Laravel application's `config` directory.

## Manually including Livewire's frontend assets

By default, Livewire injects the JavaScript and CSS assets it needs into each page that includes a Livewire component.

If you want more control over this behavior, you can manually include the assets on a page using the following Blade directives:

```blade
<html>
<head>
	...
	@livewireStyles
</head>
<body>
	...
	@livewireScripts
</body>
</html>
```

By including these assets manually on a page, Livewire knows not to inject the assets automatically.

> [!warning] AlpineJS is bundled with Livewire
> Because Alpine is bundled with Livewire's JavaScript assets, you must include @verbatim`@livewireScripts`@endverbatim on every page you wish to use Alpine. Even if you're not using Livewire on that page.

Though rarely required, you may disable Livewire's auto-injecting asset behavior by updating the `inject_assets` [configuration option](#publishing-the-configuration-file) in your application's `config/livewire.php` file:

```php
'inject_assets' => false,
```

If you'd rather force Livewire to inject its assets on a single page or multiple pages, you can call the following global method from the current route or from a service provider.

```php
\Livewire\Livewire::forceAssetInjection();
```

## Configuring Livewire's update endpoint

Every update in a Livewire component sends a network request to the server at the following default endpoint: `https://example.com/livewire/update`

This can be a problem for some applications that use localization or multi-tenancy, or that have specific constraints on their URL space.

In those cases, you can register your own endpoint however you like.
Ir order to do that, you can either change the configuration of livewire or use the provided  method `Livewire::setUpdateRoute():

### Using the configuration
By default, when the Livewire service provider is registered then booted, it will register its routes by taking the definition from the configuration.

Livewire's configuration includes a `routes` section which allows you to define the url and the middleware to apply to the update endpoint.

Change the `url` or the `middlewares` part as you need:
```php
'routes' => [
        'livewire_update' => [
            'url' => '/livewire/update',
            'middlewares' => ['web'],
        ],
```

### Using the provided method
If you prefer, you can use the `Livewire::setUpdateRoute($callback, $url = null, $middlewares = null)` method. 

You must provide a callback to this method accepting 3 parameters: the handle which should handle the update requests, the url which should be registered for the update route, and the middlewares to apply.
This callback is expected to return the registered route, and the setUpdateRoute will take care of naming the route appropriately so that the other components of Livewire recognize this new route as the livewire update route.

Please note that you cannot change the handle which will always be the HandleRequests handleUpdate method.

If you provide only the call back to the setUpdateRoute, this callback will be called with the url and the middlewares taken from livewire configuration :

```php
Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle, $url, $middlewares) {
	return Route::post('/custom/livewire/update', $handle);
}); // setUpdateRoute is provided with the callback, but the $url and $middlewares parameters are left as null.
```

If you also provide a url and a middlewares array, the callback will be called and passed those url and middlewares that you specified. The following example will define the livewire update route as begin `/custom/livewire/update/route` and will apply the 

```php
Livewire::setUpdateRoute(function ($handle, $url, $middlewares) {
	return Route::post($url, $handle)->middleware($middlewares);
}, 
'/custom/livewire/update/route',  // This will replace the url taken from the livewire configuration and provided to the callback.
['web'] // This will replace the middlewares array taken from the livewire configuration.
);
```

Now, instead of using `/livewire/update`, Livewire will send component updates to `/custom/livewire/update/route`.

Please also note that that `Livewire::setUpdateRoute()` will avoid to overwrite a previous call made for example from another service provider in order not to replace a custom defined endpoint with the default values.

## Customizing the asset URL

By default, Livewire will serve its JavaScript assets from the following URL: `https://example.com/livewire/livewire.js`. Additionally, Livewire will reference this asset from a script tag like so:

```blade
<script src="/livewire/livewire.js" ...
```

If your application has global route prefixes due to localization or multi-tenancy, you can register your own endpoint that Livewire should use internally when fetching its JavaScript.

Just as for the update endpoint, you can either use the livewire configuration section to define url and middlewares that will be registered for this route.
You can specify the url for non-debug environnement, and the url for debug environnements.

Or you can define the endpoint from another service provider by calling `Livewire::setScriptRoute()` which accepts exactly the same parameters as the `Livewire::setUpdateRoute($callback, $url = null, $middlewares = null)` method described above.

```php
Livewire::setScriptRoute(function ($handle, $url, $middlewares) {
    return Route::get('/custom/livewire/livewire.js', $handle);
});
```

Now, Livewire will load its JavaScript like so:

```blade
<script src="/custom/livewire/livewire.js" ...
```

## Manually bundling Livewire and Alpine

By default, Alpine and Livewire are loaded using the `<script src="livewire.js">` tag, which means you have no control over the order in which these libraries are loaded. Consequently, importing and registering Alpine plugins, as shown in the example below, will no longer function:

```js
// Warning: This snippet demonstrates what NOT to do...

import Alpine from 'alpinejs'
import Clipboard from '@ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard'

Alpine.plugin(Clipboard)
Alpine.start()
```

To address this issue, we need to inform Livewire that we want to use the ESM (ECMAScript module) version ourselves and prevent the injection of the `livewire.js` script tag. To achieve this, we must add the `@livewireScriptConfig` directive to our layout file (`resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php`):

```blade
<html>
<head>
    <!-- ... -->
    @livewireStyles
    @vite(['resources/js/app.js'])
</head>
<body>
    {{ $slot }}

    @livewireScriptConfig <!-- [tl! highlight] -->
</body>
</html>
```

When Livewire detects the `@livewireScriptConfig` directive, it will refrain from injecting the Livewire and Alpine scripts. If you are using the `@livewireScripts` directive to manually load Livewire, be sure to remove it. Make sure to add the `@livewireStyles` directive if it is not already present.

The final step is importing Alpine and Livewire in our `app.js` file, allowing us to register any custom resources, and ultimately starting Livewire and Alpine:

```js
import { Livewire, Alpine } from '../../vendor/livewire/livewire/dist/livewire.esm';
import Clipboard from '@ryangjchandler/alpine-clipboard'

Alpine.plugin(Clipboard)

Livewire.start()
```

> [!tip] Rebuild your assets after composer update
> Make sure that if you are manually bundling Livewire and Alpine, that you rebuild your assets whenever you run `composer update`.

> [!warning] Not compatible with Laravel Mix
> Laravel Mix will not work if you are manually bundling Livewire and AlpineJS. Instead, we recommend that you [switch to Vite](https://laravel.com/docs/vite).

## Publishing Livewire's frontend assets

> [!warning] Publishing assets isn't necessary
> Publishing Livewire's assets isn't necessary for Livewire to run. Only do this if you have a specific need for it.

If you prefer the JavaScript assets to be served by your web server not through Laravel, use the `livewire:publish` command:

```bash
php artisan livewire:publish --assets
```

To keep assets up-to-date and avoid issues in future updates, we strongly recommend that you add the following command to your composer.json file:

```json
{
    "scripts": {
        "post-update-cmd": [
            // Other scripts
            "@php artisan vendor:publish --tag=livewire:assets --ansi --force"
        ]
    }
}
```
